'''### 1. **Basic Calculator**

Write a program that asks the user to input two numbers and an arithmetic operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)
and then performs that operation on the numbers. Handle cases where division by zero may occur.
**Bonus:** Add support for more operations, such as exponentiation (`**`) and modulu me know
if youâ€™d like more advanced tasks or additional hints for any of these assignments!'''
